# wbc classification model

[![Datmo Model](https://datmo.io/shabazp/wbc-classification/badge.svg)](https://datmo.io/shabazp/wbc-classification)

WBC classification system using keras tensorflow 

This model uses Convolution Neural Networks to classify between mononuclear and polynuclear cells. 

Clone this model on your local machine with the Datmo CLI

     $ datmo clone shabazp/wbc-classification

Now you can run the set of commands below to better understand the advantages of converting a repository to a Datmo Model. 

First you can check out all of the snapshots that have already been created by the user. This is equivalent to checking out the snapshots tab on Datmo except without the search and filter capabilities available on the GUI.

     $ datmo snapshot ls 

Once you have viewed all of the existing snapshots, you can start by running an experiment by simply running the code below which runs the fraud detection training code.

     $ datmo task run "jupyter notebook" --port 8888

Create your first snapshot, by running the following command 

     $ datmo snapshot create -m "my first snapshot"
     
Congrats! You have created your first snapshot and are ready to continue building on top of it. Check out more commands on [our docs here](https://docs.datmo.com).

Happy Building :)
